This is a toy example of how you can use IPShield in production with Ruby:

1. No additional packages are required as we're using the standard library
2. Replace "your-ipshield-server.com" with your actual IPShield server address
3. Implement error handling and potentially add retry logic for production use

```ruby
require 'resolv'

def check_ip(ip)
  resolver = Resolv::DNS.new(nameserver: ['your-ipshield-server.com'])
  begin
    result = resolver.getresource(ip, Resolv::DNS::Resource::IN::TXT)
    result.strings.first
  rescue Resolv::ResolvError => e
    raise "Error checking IP: #{e.message}"
  end
end

ip = "8.8.8.8"
begin
  result = check_ip(ip)
  puts "IP #{ip} status: #{result}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end
```
