This is a toy example of how you can use IPShield in production with Python:

1. Install the dnspython package: `pip install dnspython`
2. Replace "your-ipshield-server.com" with your actual IPShield server address
3. Implement error handling and potentially add retry logic for production use

```py
import dns.resolver

def check_ip(ip):
    resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
    resolver.nameservers = ['your-ipshield-server.com']

    try:
        answers = resolver.resolve(ip, 'TXT')
        return answers[0].strings[0].decode('utf-8')
    except dns.exception.DNSException as e:
        raise Exception(f"Error checking IP: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ip = "8.8.8.8"
    try:
        result = check_ip(ip)
        print(f"IP {ip} status: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```
